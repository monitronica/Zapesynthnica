# Zapesynthnica
"Stepped-tone generator" on a bracelet.
Zapesynthnica is a synthesizer on a bracelet. "Stepped-tone generator" is the official name of the synthesizer based on the 555 chip, and its author Forrest Mims called it the "Sound Synthesizer" in 1982, later it got the name by which most people know it today: the Atari punk console. Zapesynthnica is just an old idea in a new form.
